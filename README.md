# prime-factorization
This is an implementation of [Fermat's factorization method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_factorization_method) on steroids. It combines brute force power and some mathematical trickery. With enough compute power, the prime factors are obtained in seconds.

# How to run
Run the following command:
$ g++ factor.cpp -o factor
$ ./factor
